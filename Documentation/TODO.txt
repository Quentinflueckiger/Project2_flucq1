//Might not be done in the same order

1. Learn how to use Latex. Resolve compile problem, which is most likely some package missing.

2. Rig the robot arm. ? maybe not needed => wasn't needed
 
3. Create a few animation for the robot. In Blender or Unity ? => Made in Unity
	Create animation for every part of the robot,
	and then use a blend tree to melt/mix/blend 
	different animation. For exemple one 
	animation to rotate the base mixed with
	one which move the "head". => Changed to an easier way. 

4. Set up a Voxel matrice/world in Unity.

5. Import and set up the model with the animations in Unity. => Not entirely needed as the animations were made in Unity.
	Play different animation, on button pressed or whatever.

6. A goal list.

7. Add something to the Kuka model to use as "collider detector" for the voxel matrice. 
	Maybe something such as boxcollider, or even capsule collider depending
	on the precision we want.
